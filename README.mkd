libfoxxy
========

A collection of Python utilities.

I've been programming in Python for five years now. In this time, I've written
the same things time and time again. libfoxxy is my effort to prevent this.

**Warning**: This is my personal library, there is no stable API. I will change
things when ever and how ever I want.
